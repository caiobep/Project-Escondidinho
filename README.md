# Project-Escondidinho
This is a Couse Conclusion Project about Making a website for Bakery

This project will help people buy anything a bakery can sell. This website will alow the client to
pre-order or ask for a product shipping to his house, so he can make his day more productive and not
spend his time with useless things.
